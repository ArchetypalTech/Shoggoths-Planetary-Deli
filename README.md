# :octopus: Shoggoths Deli no.23 "purveyor of fine meats"

An experiment in composability and discovery.

**initially built for the Dojo Game Jam @ Dojo Sensei Residency NYC 2024**

This is a fork of the work done on the game jam. For the original repo see [here](https://github.com/underware-gg/pistols-64)

## :raised_hand: What/Why?

We want to call other worlds and cause state changes and trigger events. These events would ideally feedback across the interacting worlds, in other words we want to experiment with composability.

To do this we need to know about other worlds, this is where this system comes in to play.

Right now we have to know where these worlds are, their addresses, their contracts etc and assuming we have this information we would then have to hard code this into our world. Ugh.

Currently there is no means of one world finding an other worlds's address. Ugh (again).

So we propose a system where we can register our world find other worlds and by extention allow other worlds to discover us.
i.e. **Discovery**

This discovery service should function in a similar fashion to DNS but for onchain AW's. 

Once found we would then like to call them (in this case via interfaces that allow for the creation of dispatchers to the now discovered systems).
i.e. **Composability**

## :bulb: High level view

* The `Deli`, the `discovery` service.
  * `Planetary` is a Dojo world deployed on Katana/Slot/Starknet
    * It provides the `planetary_interface` for world discovery.
  * Worlds need to `register()` to `Planetary` to be discoverable, usually at `dojo_init()`.
  * Any world can discover other worlds from the interface.
* The interfaces, the means by which we interact with discovered systems, the `composability` part.
  * Discoverable worlds need their interface to be included in the `Planetary` interface.
* The Dojo worlds themselves.


## Contents
### Dojo Contracts

* `/dojo/planetary`: world catalogue
* `/dojo/planetary_interface`: interface for **planetary** (crate), imported by worlds to connect to each other
* `/dojo/pistols64`: mini-pistols game contracts

### Clients

* `/clients/sdk`: generated files from the `pistols64` contract (manifest, typescript, GraphQL)
* `/clients/terminal`: Python shell terminal client
* [TheOrugginTrail](https://github.com/ArchetypalTech/TheOrugginTrail-DoJo): text adventure client, added as a submodule.
## üåé The Planetary System/Shoggoths Deli no.23

**Planetary** is a Dojo world that connects other Dojo worlds.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a proof of concept, not secure, not meant for production.


<!-- Things to do and consider for future developments:

* Some protection around who can register and unregister worlds. Adding the worlds class hashes to the interface and checking the caller class hash matches it.
 -->

![Planetary System](images/graph.png)

1. worlds register their address to the the planetary interface.
2. worlds query planetary to find other worlds and their addresses.
3. worlds (having implemented the dispatcher interfaces exposed by planetary) can interact with other worlds.
4. :bacon:

## ü™ê Planetary integration

Import `planetary_interface ` in your Dojo project `Scarb.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
dojo = { git = "https://github.com/dojoengine/dojo", tag = "v1.0.0-alpha.7" }
planetary_interface = { git = "https://github.com/ArchetypalTech/shoggoths-planetary-deli", branch = "main" }
# planetary_interface = { path = "../planetary_interface" }
```


### To discover a world

There's a test planet called **Vulcan** included in the planetary system. When saluted with `live_long()`, it replies `and_prosper`.

Example accessing Vulcan from [pistols64](/dojo/pistols64/src/systems/action.cairo).

```rust
#[dojo::contract]
mod actions {
    use planetary_interface::interfaces::vulcan::{
        VulcanInterface, VulcanInterfaceTrait,
        IVulcanSaluteDispatcher, IVulcanSaluteDispatcherTrait,
    };
    
    // ...

    // test with sozo:
    // sozo call pistols64-actions live_long
    fn live_long(world: @IWorldDispatcher) -> felt252 {
        let vulcan: IVulcanSaluteDispatcher = VulcanInterfaceTrait::new().dispatcher();
        (vulcan.live_long())
    }
}

```


### To make your world discoverable

The system interface has to be included in `planetary_interface`.
Example: [vulcan interface](/dojo/planetary_interface/src/interfaces/vulcan.cairo)

Then register it from the system you want to expose:
Example: [vulcan system](/dojo/planetary_interface/src/systems/vulcan.cairo)

```rust
use starknet::{ContractAddress};

#[dojo::interface]
trait IVulcan {
    fn live_long(world: @IWorldDispatcher) -> felt252;
}

#[dojo::contract(namespace: "vulcan", nomapping: true)]
mod salute {
    use planetary_interface::interfaces::planetary::{
        PlanetaryInterface, PlanetaryInterfaceTrait,
        IPlanetaryActionsDispatcher, IPlanetaryActionsDispatcherTrait,
    };
    use planetary_interface::interfaces::vulcan::{
        VulcanInterface, VulcanInterfaceTrait,
    };
    use planetary_interface::utils::misc::{WORLD};

    fn dojo_init(ref world: IWorldDispatcher) {
        let planetary: PlanetaryInterface = PlanetaryInterfaceTrait::new();
        planetary.dispatcher().register(VulcanInterfaceTrait::NAMESPACE, world.contract_address);
    }

    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl IVulcanImpl of IVulcan<ContractState> {
        fn live_long(world: @IWorldDispatcher) -> felt252 {
            ('and_prosper')
        }
    }
}

```


## üöÄ Running locally

Install Dojo `1.0.0-alpha.7`, Scarb `2.7` and Cargo. See the [Dojo Book](https://book.dojoengine.org/getting-started/).

Stuff you might need...

```sh
brew install jq
brew install protobuf
cargo install toml-cli
```

Start up one [Katana](https://book.dojoengine.org/toolchain/katana) instance:

```sh
cd dojo/planetary
./run_katana
```

Migrate Planetary

```sh
cd dojo/planetary
./migrate
```

Migrate your game to the same Katana

```sh
cd dojo/pistols64
./migrate
```

Start up a [Torii](https://book.dojoengine.org/toolchain/torii) server **indexing your game world**. Planetary does not need to be indexed, as it's intended to be be interacted on-chain only.

```sh
cd dojo/pistols64
./run_torii
```


## üêô TheOrugginTrail Interop

This assumes that `planetary` and `pistols64` are deployed to the same katana as explained above.

Fetch the TOT submodule.

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Migrate TOT.

```sh
cd TheOrugginTrail-Dojo
./migrate
```
## Interop P64 -> TOT
You can send commands into `TheOrugginTrail` from `Pistols64` from the script below.

e.g. To call `TheOrugginTrail` from `Pistols64` with the command `look around`

```sh
./cmd_shoggoth path_to_pistols64_Scarb.toml look around
```

Feel salty and want to start a fight? We got you.

```sh
./cmd_shoggoth path_to_pistols64_Scarb.toml fight the power
```

This command calls into `TheOrugginTrail` from `Pistols64` and starts a fight by calling back into `Pistols64` from `TheOrugginTrail`.

## Interop TOT -> P64

Assuming you are in the `TheOrugginTrail` directory, you can call `Pistols64` from `TheOrugginTrail` with the script below.

```sh
./start_fight
```
It wraps a command string "fight the man" which triggers the call from `TheOrugginTrail` world to the `Pistols64` world.


## üíæ Run the shell terminal client

See [clients/terminal/README.md](clients/terminal/README.md).
